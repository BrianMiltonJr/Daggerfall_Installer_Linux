# Daggerfall_Installer_Linux

An easy lightweight Script that sets daggerfall up by downloading daggerfall, setting up the filesystem, and using cheeky dosbox configs to automate most of the Daggerfall installation progress. Have fun :P

This script downloads Dosbox for emulating daggerfall.
It also adds a Desktop Launcher for easy automated daggerfall fun
